#### Is this well-tested? Can I use it in my billion dollar project?
The test coverage of the project is 93%. The project is minimal and has no fluff, and the code quality is what you expect to see in scalable systems at a major tech company.

That being said, I have only used it in some of my projects, so it does not officially have the 'battle-tested' badge yet.

If you find any bugs, please report them!

#### Should I expect breaking changes in the future?
Yes, nothing is set in stone here yet. I will provide detailed docs if breaking changes happen.

#### Are there any limitations in MinjeKt?
As of now,

MinjeKt does not support templates. You can work around this by adding templates as default constructor parameters and MinjeKt will honor them.

MinjeKt has no annotations, and it only supports constructor injection.
